		 Constructor:   special method. execution depends on the creation of the object
		1. every class MUST have constructor, if there isn't any then compiler will give default constructor(no-arg constructor)  
		2. constructor' method CAN NOT have Return-Type and specifier
		3. constructor' method name MUST be same with className
		4. constructor' execution depends on the creation of the object
		5. Constructor can only be called in another constructor, other methods cannot call the constructor
		6. constructor CAN NOT be called by method name, MUST use this or super (to call superclass' constructor) keywords.
		7. constructor CAN NOT call itself
		8. constructor CAN NOT call more than one constructor
		9. in constructor' body  constructor call needs to be the first step.
		10. every class MUST have constructor, if there isn't any then compiler will give default constructor(no-arg constructor)
		11. class' object MUST be created with the existing constructors 
		
		12. super class' default constructor (no-arg) is called in sub class' constructor(any constructor) by default 
		13. super class' constructor ( except for default) MUST be called in sub class'
